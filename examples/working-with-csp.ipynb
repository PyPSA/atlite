    "### Installation specific efficiencies and properties\n",
    "\n",
    "`atlite` uses a simplified approach in modelling CSP. The technology-specific direct irradiation is modified by an efficiency which depends on the local solar position.\n",
    "The reason for an efficiency which is solar dependend is that a CSP installation can not perfectly absorb all direct irradiation at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effects causing less-than-perfect efficiency are e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* shadowing between rows and adjacents heliostats\n",
    "* maximum tracking angles\n",
    "* system design for reduced efficiency during peak irradiation hours in favour of increased efficiency during off-peak sunset/sunrise\n",
